# What is FOR600?

FOR526: An In-Depth Memory Forensics Training Course

Malware Can Hide, But It Must Run

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) professionals need Windows memory forensics training to be at the top of their game. 

Investigators who do not look at volatile memory are leaving evidence at the crime scene. RAM content holds evidence of user actions, 

as well as evil processes and furtive behaviors implemented by malicious code. It is this evidence that often proves to be the 

smoking gun that unravels the story of what happened on a system.

FOR526: Memory Forensics In-Depth provides the critical skills necessary for digital forensics examiners and incident responders 

to successfully perform live system memory triage and analyze captured memory images. The course uses the most effective freeware 

and open-source tools in the industry today and provides an in-depth understanding of how these tools work. 

FOR526 is a critical course for any serious DFIR investigator who wants to tackle advanced forensics, trusted insider, and incident response cases.
