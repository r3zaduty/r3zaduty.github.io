# What is FOR572?

FOR572: ADVANCED NETWORK FORENSICS: THREAT HUNTING, ANALYSIS AND INCIDENT RESPONSE was designed to cover the most critical skills 

needed for the increased focus on network communications and artifacts in today's investigative work, 

including numerous use cases. Many investigative teams are incorporating proactive threat hunting to their skills, 

in which existing evidence is used with newly-acquired threat intelligence to uncover evidence of previously-unidentified incidents.

Others focus on post-incident investigations and reporting. Still others engage with an adversary in real time, 

seeking to contain and eradicate the attacker from the victim's environment. In these situations and more, 

the artifacts left behind from attackers' communications can provide an invaluable view into their intent, capabilities, successes, 

and failures.
