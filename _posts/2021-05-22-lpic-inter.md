# What is LPIC-2?

LPIC-2 is the second certification in LPI’s multi-level professional certification program. 

The LPIC-2 will validate the candidate's ability to administer small to medium–sized mixed networks. 

The candidate must have an active LPIC-1 certification to receive LPIC-2 certification, 

but the LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 exams may be taken in any order.
