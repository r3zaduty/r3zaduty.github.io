# What is SEC660?

SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing, and Ethical Hacking is designed as a logical progression point 

for those who have completed SANS SEC560: Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking, or for those with 

existing penetration testing experience. Students with the prerequisite knowledge to take this course will walk through dozens 

of real-world attacks used by the most seasoned penetration testers. The methodology of a given attack is discussed, 

followed by exercises in a hands-on lab to consolidate advanced concepts and facilitate the immediate application of techniques 

in the workplace. Each day of the course includes a two-hour evening boot camp to drive home additional mastery of the techniques discussed. 

A sample of topics covered includes weaponizing Python for penetration testers, attacks against network access control (NAC) 

and virtual local area network (VLAN) manipulation, network device exploitation, breaking out of Linux and Windows restricted environments, 

IPv6, Linux privilege escalation and exploit-writing, testing cryptographic implementations, fuzzing, defeating modern OS controls 

such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), return-oriented programming (ROP), 

Windows exploit-writing, and much more!
