# What is SEC575?

Imagine an attack surface that is spread across your organization and in the hands of every user. 

It moves regularly from place to place, stores highly sensitive and critical data, and sports numerous 

and different wireless technologies all ripe for attack. Unfortunately, such a surface already exists today: 

mobile devices. These devices constitute the biggest attack surface in most organizations, yet these same organizations 

often don't have the skills needed to assess them.
