# What is SEC760?

Vulnerabilities in modern operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 10 and the latest Linux distributions are often very complex 

and subtle. When exploited by very skilled attackers, these vulnerabilities can undermine an organization's defenses and expose 

it to significant damage. Few security professionals have the skillset to discover why a complex vulnerability exists and 

how to write an exploit to compromise it. Conversely, attackers must maintain this skillset regardless of the increased complexity. 

SEC760: Advanced Exploit Development for Penetration Testers teaches the skills required to reverse-engineer 32-bit and 64-bit applications 

to find vulnerabilities, perform remote user application and kernel debugging, analyze patches for one-day exploits, and write complex exploits 

such as use-after-free attacks against modern software and operating systems.
